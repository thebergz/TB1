Airspace is a clean, unique, and free bootstrap website template, contributed to the community by [Themefisher]. Built with refined business as well as corporate elements, and saturated with rich typography, Airspace is lightweight, fast-loading, responsive and W3C-validated, delivering a great first impression to visitors.

Airspace uses HTML5/CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery, and the [Bootstrap 3 framework](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/), assuring the best viewing experience on major web browsers including IE9/IE10/IE11, Firefox, Safari, Opera and Chrome, for any screen sizes of desktop and mobile devices.

And now, Airspace has been ported to [Hugo] .

## Usage

Create a new Hugo site by typing

```
  $ hugo new site <SITENAME>
```

Then clone this repository:

```
  $ cd <SITENAME>/themes
  $ git clone https://github.com/themefisher/airspace-hugo.git
```

Now take a look at the exampleSite folder and you're ready to go!
